The **Genotype-Phenotype Explorer** is a prototype web application for visualizing biomedical data, based on the [Monarch Initiative](http://monarchinitiative.org/).

The app is not yet fully featured. It has been developed for a usability study at Oregon Health & Science University.

The prototype contains a small dataset of human and mouse genes, genotypes, variants, phenotypes, and diseases. Data were obtained August 15-17, 2015, with the [Dipper](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/dipper) package and from the [Mouse Genome Informatics](http://www.informatics.jax.org/) and [Human Phenotype Ontology](http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org/) sites.

The app has been tested and is functional in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari running on Mac OS X 10.8 and later. To properly view it in Chrome, the app must be served from a local web host.
