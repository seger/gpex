<h4>The graph</h4>
<p>
    Biological relationships are represented in a graph comprising <strong><em>nodes</em></strong> (entities) and <strong><em>edges</em></strong> (relationships).
</p>
<p>
    A node's color indicates the type of data it represents, and its shape indicates the species.
</p>
<p>
    An edge's width increases with the number of sources that provide evidence for the relationship. Use the configuration <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></i> panel to also apply a black-red color scale to the edges; edges with larger amounts of sources will appear redder.
</p>
<hr />
<h4>Selection details</h4>
<p>
    When you click on a node or edge, information about your selection appears in the panel at right.
</p>
<p>
    To view items related to a selected node, click on a section heading to expand it, and use the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus-sign"></i> and <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus-sign"></i> icons to expand or contract the hierarchy. Click on the name of an item to add it to the graph. The <span class="total-rel">number</span> following an item's name indicates how many more items are related to it.
</p>
<p>
    To view publications or other evidence for a selected edge, click on the <strong>Sources</strong> section heading.
</p>
<hr />
<h4>Manipulating the graph</h4>
<p>
    <strong><em>Single-click</em></strong> on a node to pin and drag it. A red outline <img width="18" height="18" src="graphics/pinned-node.png" /> will appear around it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Double-click</em></strong> on a node to unpin it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Right-click</em></strong> on a node to view a popup listing the type and number of nodes related to it. You can choose to display all related nodes, click on a data type to reveal any such nodes that are not yet displayed, or remove the node that you are on.
</p>
<p>
    Nodes that you have clicked on are listed in the <strong>History</strong> dropdown menu at upper left. To remove all unpinned nodes from the display, click the <strong>Show only pinned</strong> button.
</p>
<p>
    Use the configuration <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></i> panel to make item descriptions appear in the popup instead of the selection details panel.
