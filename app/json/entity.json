The mother had external strabismus, retrognathia, posteriorly angulated ears, broad neck with low posterior hairline, short 5th fingers, and a high-arched palate. The 12-year-old sister showed mild retrognathia, thin vermilion border of the upper lip, low-set, posteriorly angulated ears with overfolded helices, high-arched palate, and mild muscular hypotonia. Both the mother and sister had a history of recurrent bronchitis, but immunologic investigations were normal. Both also had mild learning difficulties. The brother and father were unaffected. Echocardiographic, immunologic, endocrine, and pharyngoscopic studies in the parents and sibs of the patient did not show any abnormalities. FISH analysis of the proband, mother, and sister detected a heterozygous chromosome 22q11.2 deletion that was distal to the common 3-Mb deletion region. Rauch et al. (1999) noted that the facial gestalt of the affected individuals differed from that observed in DGS and VCFS.

(2008) found considerable variability in the level of phenotypic expression of the microdeletion; phenotypes included mild to moderate mental retardation, microcephaly, cardiac abnormalities, and cataracts. The majority of persons with the deletion had a history of mild to moderate developmental delay (16 of 21, 76.2%) and dysmorphic features (17 of 21, 81%), consistent with their ascertainment criteria. Three parents were also mildly affected; however, 5 probands had normal cognitive development, and 4 apparently unaffected parents had the same deletion. In addition, 14 of the 21 patients (66.7%) and 2 parents with the deletion had microcephaly or relative microcephaly. Other phenotypic features noted in more than 1 patient with deletion included ligamentous laxity or joint hypermobility in 5, congenital heart abnormality in 6, hypotonia in 5, seizures in 3, and cataracts in 3. Facial anomalies were quite variable and generally mild. There were no notable phenotypic differences among carriers of a deletion with different breakpoints. Interestingly, this same deletion was recently described in an adult patient with schizophrenia (Walsh et al., 2008). Mefford et al. (2008) mapped the breakpoint in this patient and found it to be identical to that found in their sample of patients. Mefford et al. (2008) noted that they found this deletion in 0.5% of patients with developmental abnormalities studied.

(2013) reported 3 fetuses from a consanguineous pedigree who presented in utero with enlarged organs and cystic/dysplastic changes in the kidney, liver, and pancreas. Two of the affected pregnancies were terminated at 21 and 22 weeks' gestation, and the third was terminated at 18 weeks' gestation after intrauterine fetal demise. Additional features found in at least 1 of the fetuses included severe heart defects, such as truncus arteriosus and unseptated atrium and ventricle, hypoplastic lungs with lobulation defects, asplenia, uterine agenesis, and shortened legs due to bowed femurs. One patient had a right-sided stomach, consistent with heterotaxy or isomerism. Two patients had Potter sequence associated with oligo-/anhydramnios. Histologic examination of tissues from 2 of the fetuses showed cystic changes in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas. Liver samples showed hepatic fibrosis with ductal plate malformation, and the pancreas showed rudimentary lobulation and reduced acinar units as well as complete absence of the islets of Langerhans. The kidneys consisted of predominantly immature mesenchyme with no zonal partition between cortical and medullary areas, and the glomeruli were immature and decreased in number.
